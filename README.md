# Advanced_SQL_Analytics_Project


## Overview
This repository contains a collection of advanced SQL scripts designed to perform comprehensive data analysis and generate insightful key performance indicators (KPIs). The project demonstrates various advanced SQL techniques including data segmentation, performance analysis, cumulative analysis, part-to-whole analysis, and more.

## Project Description
The scripts in this repository are aimed at exploring, analyzing, and reporting on business metrics using a sample data warehouse. The key functionalities include:

- **KPI Building:** Generating meaningful performance indicators through data aggregation.
- **Data Segmentation:** Classifying and segmenting data based on customer demographics and purchase behavior.
- **Product Reporting:** Creating detailed reports on product performance, covering sales figures, order counts, and customer metrics.
- **Cumulative Analysis:** Analyzing trends over time with cumulative metrics.
- **Database Exploration:** Investigating the underlying database schema and relationships.
- **Part-To-Whole Analysis:** Evaluating how individual segments contribute to overall performance.
- **Performance Analysis:** Assessing query efficiency and overall system performance.
